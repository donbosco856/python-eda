#### Preprocessing
The preprocessing stage involved addressing issues within the dataset to ensure the analysis was accurate and meaningful. One of the key tasks was correcting the data in the height column by replacing it with random values between 150 cm and 180 cm. This step was crucial for maintaining data consistency. Additionally, any missing data was managed to preserve the integrity of the dataset, allowing for a smooth transition into the analysis phase.
#### INSIGHTS GAINED
1.The majority of employees are concentrated in certain teams, indicating potential areas of focus for the company. For example, if 'New Orleans Pelicans' has the largest number of employees, it could be a key driver of company operations.  
2.The distribution across positions reveals which roles are most common in the organization. If 'Position SG' is predominant, it may be a critical role for the company's success.  
3.The most common age group provides insight into the demographic profile of the workforce. This can inform HR strategies, particularly ain areas such as employee engagement and retention  
4.Teams and positions with the highest salary expenditures highlight areas where the company is making significant financial investments.These could be critical roles or teams driving key projects.  
5.The correlation (or lack thereof) between age and salary can indicate how compensation is structured within the company. If there's a strong postive correlation, older employees might generally be earning more, which could reflect seniority-based pay scales. But here it has a weak correlation between age and salary which indicates that salary cant be salary can predicted by age
